This project is a Sample Space-X Website completely made using REACT.

It consist of a Launch Page and Tabs like History, Rockets, Launches and About and information regarding the Next Launch and Mission information of Space X. The data is taken from  https://api.spacexdata.com/v3

We can also get a detailed view of Next Launch and Various Launches made in Space X.
I have used a minimal third party libraries for CSS, mostly styles are coded.

File structure:

src/components/ contains the function components
src/css/ contails Styling

Pages will be responsive and more informative. Menu Bar (Hamburger) will be really cool.

This app can be viewed in Desktop, Tabs and Mobile Phones. I have tried resposiveness to the maximum without third party Libraries.

With more time I would have tried to implement more Animations.
